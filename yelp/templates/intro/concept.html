      <h2>Direct and Indirect Effects of Spatial Competition on Business Ratings</h2>
      <p>Economic theory traditionally assumes the role of price to be an indicator of sacrifice. However, behavioral and empirical research on actual purchase behavior has shown that price may also convey information about a product’s quality (Erickson and Johansson 1985; Leavitt 1954). Acknowledging the dual role of price, research in the behavioral sciences has focused on empirically verifying the link between price level and perceptions of quality. Although meta-analytic reviews of this research provide evidence for a moderately strong relationship between price level and perceived quality (Völckner and Hofmann 2007), some scholars question the universal validity of this link (Zeithaml 1988). Research therefore has turned to the examination of information-processing issues underlying price-quality inferences. In this research, I introduce the concept of spatial competition as a context factor influencing the relative salience of these two roles of price on quality perceptions reflected as customer ratings.</p>
      <p>The price–perceived quality relationship constitutes a positively valenced perception that indicates the excellence of a product (Zeithaml 1988). In what follows, we introduce the concept of psychological distance as a context factor influencing the relative salience of these two roles of price. Therefore, with a more intense spatial competition, the quality inference of higher price levels will be more prominent due to the fact that customers trying to decide on one out of many businesses will be more likely to rely on contextual cues, i.e. quality signal of price. </p>
      <p>In contrast, behavioral research conceptualizes the price–perceived sacrifice relationship as a means-related perception. In this role, price is negatively valenced as it indicates what is given up to obtain the benefits associated with a product (Ahtola 1984). Hence, businesses face more moderate or low spatial competition will be more likely to be judged by the higher expectations driven by the higher price levels. Therefore, this research proposes an explanation that might account for the dual role of price on judgements and decisions.</p>
      <p>However, it is also worthwhile to investigate the possible industry effects on spatial distance and/or price on customers’ quality perceptions. Some industries might be primarily driven by the number of direct competitors and the geographical distance to them (see Baum & Mezias, 1992 for a similar assumption in hotel industry); while some others might not. Hence, I control for the industry effect by specifying a hierarchical model for the estimation.</p>
      <p>Another factor that might potentially confound with the main interest of this research is the effect of spatial competition on firms’ price levels. It has been shown that in markets where spatial competition is important prices vary depending on the intensity of the competition. Specifically, many models predict that average prices are lower in markets with more businesses per unit area (i.e., a more intense spatial competition). Businesses with higher prices try to attract a certain customers, while those with lower prices place their emphasis on operating at full capacity to have minimum operation average costs. Hence, it is likely that these two types of firms might react differently to an increase in competition. Although the main objective is measuring the indirect effect of competition on ratings through price, the model has to account for also the possible direct impact of competition on price.</p>
      <p>So, understanding how competition and price act together on customer satisfaction and judgement (i.e., business ratings) means we can understand and even predict their influence on the probabilities of success or failure of new businesses entering the market.</p>
